# Hello!

This is a just a simple repo that I will try to maintain throughout the months ( maybe years ) of resources that will attempt 
to list down really useful and helpful diamonds-in-the-rough links to get beginners like myself quickly prepared for real,
challenging problems.

This isn't much. It's half an hour left till 2 in the morning, and I'm a bit tired to write more.

In short, just a list of useful links. Nothing more than that.

<em>Thanks for your time!</em>
